# Cleaning-mode

This is to make a cleaning mode for a mac computer.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository and run the script.
2. Then you will be able to use the cleaning mode by pressing the option key 3 times.
3. Make sure you add the permissions to the file before attempting to run.

In this iteration of the product, the cleaning mode will disable all of the keys on the keyboard when the option key is pressed 3 times. 

For future iterations, it would be possible to completely reduce the brightness of the screen so cleaning the screen would also be possible.
